# AES Text Encryption Decryption Tool

## Overview

The AES Text Encryption Decryption Tool is a Python-based application for encrypting and decrypting text using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm.

### Features

- **Encryption**: Encrypts plain text using AES with a specified key and initialization vector (IV).
- **Decryption**: Decrypts AES-encrypted text back to its original form using the same key and IV.
- **Key and IV Management**: Allows users to specify custom keys and IVs for encryption and decryption.
- **Text Input and Output**: Accepts text input for encryption and decryption, providing clear feedback on the encrypted or decrypted output.

2. **Install dependencies** (if any):

No additional dependencies are required beyond Python's standard library for AES encryption.

3. **Run the application**:
AES_TextEncryptionTool.py

4. **Encrypt and Decrypt**:
- Enter your text input for encryption.
- Specify a key and initialization vector (IV) for encryption.
- Click the "Encrypt" button to obtain the encrypted text.
- To decrypt, paste the encrypted text and use the same key and IV to retrieve the original text by clicking the "Decrypt" button.

5. **Use responsibly**:
- Ensure secure management of keys and IVs.
- Understand the implications of encrypting and decrypting sensitive information.
